    "LongDescription": "Change Skyrim's weight system from weight-based to slot based. \n\nThis patcher adjusts the weight and carryweight system of Skyrim to mimic the slot based inventory systems found in a lot of other games. One big inspiration was Dying Light which only has a limit for the number of weapons you can carry. \n\nSo to describe it a bit more, this patcher sets every weapon and piece of clothing to have a weight between 1-5 (based on their relative weights), ingredients and other misc items are set to have no weight (except potions) at all and it reduces the base carry weight of every playable race to 25. Any items/spells/perks/potions that alter the carry weight stat are reduced to 40% of their base value. \n\n\nThanks a lot to Halgari for creating the 1st draft of this inspired by my idea and allowing me to take over to finalize it. \n\n- Luca|EzioTheDeadPoet",
